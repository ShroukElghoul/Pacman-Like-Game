The application supports 2 modes: **Grid Mode** and **Game Mode**.<br/>
In grid mode, the user interacts with the application through the menu icons that are in tool bar (top of the window). The application should also provide a status bar that to print messages to the user and to display game progress. 

The player is moving in a grid that is divided into a number of cells; a cell is specified by its row and column.<br/>
